					<p>
						At 20 years old, a passion for technology fuels my drive to explore new horizons.
					</p>
					<p>
						Growing up in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, I've been surrounded by the world of computers since a young age, thanks to my family's interest in the field. This passion has become the driving force behind my extracurricular activities, where I dedicate myself with zeal and enthusiasm.
					</p>
					<p>
						My biggest dream is to participate in an exchange program during my undergraduate studies. I believe this experience would allow me to broaden my horizons, immerse myself in different cultures, and refine both my technical and linguistic skills. I am confident that such an opportunity would be a turning point in my professional and personal journey.
					</p>
					<p>
						To achieve this goal, I seize every opportunity for learning and growth. I constantly seek out challenging projects, relevant courses, and events that connect me with renowned professionals in the field.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a result, I have developed a solid foundation in computer science, with a focus on artificial intelligence and interfaces. I am also well-versed in Python, Java, and C#, among other programming languages.
