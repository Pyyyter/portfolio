I've been involved in exciting computer vision projects that bridge the gap between technology and real-world applications. Here are two highlights:

### Automated Solar Panel Inspection

I developed a system using thermal imaging and machine learning to automatically inspect solar power plants. This helps catch problems in solar panels early on, leading to better maintenance and energy production.

### NLP projects
My portfolio includes personal natural language processing projects, in the most diverse approaches. For example, I've already used model APIs, refining the output with prompt engineering, and also explored the area of ​​fine-tuning huge local models, and I've also hosted them on local endpoints.

### Autonomous Water Quality Monitoring
I designed the autonomous system of a boat equipped with computer vision for water quality assessment. This boat uses sensors and image recognition to identify pollutants, creating a comprehensive picture of water quality.
