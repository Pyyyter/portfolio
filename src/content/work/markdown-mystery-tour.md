### Infrared (thermal) implementations


I, in partnership with <a href="https://innomaker.com.br/">INNOMAKER</a>, make rapid progress in detecting problems of all kinds in photovoltaic plants, offering a complete analysis service. All of this was implemented using computer vision, and all data is delivered both with complete technical reports and in a playful interface, delivering total quality for people with any level of knowledge. And, the best. Everything is done autonomously.



### LIDAR implementations

Still in partnership with INNOMAKER, we take the lead in the innovation of digital twins, using the most diverse range of technologies to deliver a solid mapping of the region, greatly assisting and accelerating the creation of 3D as-built models.
