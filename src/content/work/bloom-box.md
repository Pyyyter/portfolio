### Telemetry Data Acquisition and Transmission
Utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller, I've Establish a reliable data acquisition and transmission system, using a communication protocol that prevents losses, considering that the secondary communication system was in LoRA signals. This involves capturing vital telemetry data, securely transmitting it through a VPN, and delivering it to dedicated APIs for real-time analysis.

### Computer Vision for Obstacle Detection
 I've spearheaded the integration of computer vision technology to assist our pilots in navigating safely. This system utilizes image recognition to identify potential hazards in the boat's blind spots, providing timely voice alerts to warn the pilot of impending danger.
